# Gamba

## Description
Gamba is a discord bot created to play gambling games in a discord server.
Currently deployed in multiple discord servers!

## Tech Stack
Gamba uses the Discord.js library in Node.js to connect to the Discord client.
A Node.js REST API was created using Express to connect to a SQLite database to perform CRUD on all users data.

REST API is hosted on my own machine and is sent requests from my own machine which is why it points to localhost

## Demo
Here is a demo video to see Gamba in action!
